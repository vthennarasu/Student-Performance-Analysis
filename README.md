Student Performance Analysis Project

ðŸ“š Background

As motivated students, we are constantly striving for better academic results, altering various aspects of our lives to achieve this. But how do we know which factors truly have the greatest impact on our test scores? Are these factors controllable, or are they beyond our reach?

This project seeks to uncover the answers to these questions by analyzing various factors that influence students' exam scores. Through data-driven insights, we aim to identify actionable strategies students can adopt to optimize their academic performance.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Details

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes numerous factors that could influence student performance. Key variables analyzed include:

-Study habits: Hours studied, tutoring sessions attended

-Lifestyle factors: Sleep hours, physical activity

-Family dynamics: Parental involvement, education level, family income

-School characteristics: Teacher quality, school type, school distance

-Demographics: Gender, learning disabilities

-Social environment: Peer influence, access to resources, extracurricular activities

-Exam outcomes: Final exam score

ðŸ”¬ Methodology

We used a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques to uncover relationships between these variables and exam scores. Key steps included:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

-Handled missing values and outliers.

-Normalized and encoded categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

-Visualized data distributions and correlations.

-Conducted hypothesis testing on key variables.

Modeling Approaches:

-Linear Regression

-Log-transformed Regression

-K-means Clustering

ðŸš€ Key Findings

Hours Studied: A positive and significant correlation with exam scores.
Sleep Hours: Surprisingly, no strong relationship with exam performance.
Model Performance: Log-transformed regression yielded the best fit, with a high R^2 value and minimal residuals.
Actionable Insights: Students can focus on controllable factors like study habits and tutoring to boost their performance.
