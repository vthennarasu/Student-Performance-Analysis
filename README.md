# Student-Performance-Analysis

Background
As motivated students, we are constantly striving for bigger and better academic results, altering our lives in different ways to achieve this. Whether it be studying more, sleeping more, or a combination of numerous other factors, we never know what is truly responsible for earning us that beloved A. However, how do we know which factors truly have the greatest impact on our test scores? Are these factors ones we can control and alter for our benefit? Or are they forever unchangeable and out of reach? We hope to uncover the sought-after answers to these questions through our analysis.

Dataset Details
We obtained a dataset outlining student performance factors from kaggle, highlighting numerous factors that could influence a studentâ€™s exam score performance, including: hours studied, attendance, parental involvement, access to resources, extracurricular activities, hours of sleep, previous scores, motivation level, internet access, tutoring sessions attended, family income, teacher quality, school type, peer influence, physical activity, learning disabilities, parental education level, school distance from home, gender, final exam score.

Conclusion
An unexpected result from our analysis was that sleep hours did not have a significant impact on exam scores. The best-performing model was a log-transformed regression, which achieved the highest R2 value and the lowest residuals. Both linear regression and k-means clustering revealed a predominantly positive relationship between hours studied and exam scores. Our findings ultimately suggest that students have better control over variables that significantly influence their exam scores, and it is within their responsibility to leverage these factors in order to maximize their performance.
